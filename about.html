            Hi, I'm Zaid Matar, and I'm excited to be diving into the world of web development! I come from a background
            in
            [mention your previous field or interest, if applicable], and I've always had a passion for technology and
            problem-solving. As I explore web development, I'm eager to learn how to create dynamic, interactive
            websites
            that help people and businesses thrive. My interest in web development started with a curiosity about how
            websites are built, and now I'm diving deeper into coding to bring my ideas to life. I'm looking forward to
            enhancing my skills and expanding my knowledge in this exciting field.</p>
